Dr. Pham,

newpokemondatabase.sql requires one relation to use the import wizard. The relation you must populate via import is the 'card' relation, 
and the file used to import is Pokemon_Cards_-_Sheet1_5.csv . You can import by selecting the database under the Schema panel, then
selecting Table, then right clicking on 'Card' and selecting 'Data Table Import Wizard'. You shouldn't need to change any settings when going through the import
(other than selecting the csv file), and once the import has been completed, 150 records should be imported.
